Strike Force For Change participated in the Neighborhood Listening Project as part of the Resistance Summer Effort led by MoveOn.org. We decided to canvas close to home so we visited homes in the Marycrest area of CCHills. We knocked on about 35 doors and talked with the resident voters about their concerns about healthcare. We followed up with an ask to attend a Resistance Summer event in August.
