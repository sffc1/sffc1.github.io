The tsunami of constituent activity prompted by the last two Resistance Recesses have been widely credited with building the power to delay the GOP’s vicious plan to take away health care from millions of Americans.

Friends Who March is back with MoveOn, Indivisible and other allies, and ready to mobilize again during the month long August recess. 

This Resistance Summer Recess, July 28-September 4, MoveOn members and allies will show up at Members of Congress’ town halls — the few not too scared to face us — or we will organize our own rallies outside their district offices to demand health care for all and fight for our progressive values. 

Activists all over the country, including MoveOn members and Resistance Summer Mobilizers, are hosting events all over the country on issues from health care and calling for Single-Payer, to the environment to immigration. 

**#RunawayRoskam has scheduled a lunch date with the Palatine Chamber of Commerce, so Friends Who March has scheduled a protest.** 

Resist Roskam Palatine Protest 

When:  Wednesday, August 23 at 11 a.m. (local time)
Where: The Cotillion Banquets
  360 S Creekside Dr
  Palatine, IL 60074

Host notes:
Bring your signs. We will be on public property near the street. Do not park in the Banquet Hall lot. There is a big lot next to it where you can park.
