Help kick off a peaceful summer in Chicago with the students of St. Sabina and come show your support for the faith community of St. Sabina and March For Our Lives! 

Volunteers from Indivisible will be there at this rally and march to register voters and to support the south side communities hit hardest by gun violence. We will also be joining with Mom's Demand Action, Everytown Survivors, Purpose Over Pain, Black Youth Project 100, and many other organizations for the annual March for Peace.  

Rally in the parking lot of Saint Sabina Church at 78th Place and Throop Street. Rally starts at 7pm but get there early to get a t-shirt!

Special Guests: Chance the Rapper, Jennifer Hudson, Emma Gonzalez from Marjory Stoneman Douglas HS, Former Arizona Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords.

Emma Gonzales along with Students from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School of Parkland, Florida and the **March For Our Lives** students will start the Road To Change bus tour here in Chicago! Text “CHANGE” to 97779 for more info! #RoadToChange
