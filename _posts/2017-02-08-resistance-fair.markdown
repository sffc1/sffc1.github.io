Get involved. Get organized. Find a group & get to work. 

The goal of the Fair is to connect as many people as possible with local advocacy organizations for either volunteer opportunities or employment. We want to make it easy to get involved and stay involved in local issues and campaigns. 

Why should your organization be part of the Fair? It will connect you directly to potential volunteers and/or future hires who believe in progressive causes and want to get to work. By attending, your organization will be able to grow their grassroots support and build out your advocacy efforts. 

There is no cost to have a booth at the Fair or to attend it. We will have a donation jar should anyone want to help pay the costs of this event. We have space for 30 booths & will be first come, first served. Please reserve your spot by August 19th. This event will be updated with the organizations that are confirmed to be at the Fair. 

If you have any questions you can message this page, email WillCountyResistanceFair@gmail.com or call 630-519-3694.
