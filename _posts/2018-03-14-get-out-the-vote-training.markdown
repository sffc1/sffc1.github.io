### Did you miss the canvassing training that Strike Force For Change did as part of Resistance Summer 2017? 

Canvassing is a fun and rewarding experience. Now is your chance to learn more. 

Sponsored by Team Akiwowo, this training is similar to the Canvassing Training that was provided by our Resistance Summer Neighborhood Listening Project last summer on Educational/Listening Canvassing. An Educational/Listening Canvas is a growing approach to traditional canvassing that builds on exciting new research into "Deep Canvassing" as a way to persuade and motivate. This training will have a focus on GOTV motivation.

If you would like to learn Deep Canvassing techniques or if you participated in Strike Force For Change's Resistance Summer Neighborhood Listening Project Canvassing last year and need a refresher, then this Get Out The Vote Training is for you. 

If you participated in the training last year, then bring your Canvassing Guides, your Canvassing Do's and Don'ts lists, your old scripts (you will get new scripts geared to Get Out The Vote) and paper and pencils to update your knowledge gained last year. We will have pointers on how canvassing differs for Judicial Candidates. 

**During our Canvassing Training Last Year We:** 

* Geared up for upcoming elections by building canvassing skills that will help us resist, build power and win.

* Connected with our neighbors and communities. Now more than ever, itâ€™s important to listen to each other and find common ground. We win by listening to, connecting with, empowering, and bringing people together to stand up for what we believe in.

* Took action to Get Out The Vote by talking and listening to people give their stories.
