The March for Our Lives movement has been a long time coming, and is the product of a nation that values objects more than human lives. The voices for the March for Our Lives are those of the generation that grew up with mass shootings.This is the sound of millions of voices across the country pleading for change- we say enough. End the violence. There has been more than enough blood, tears, and bullets- one school shooting is a school shooting too many. However, we cannot ignore the gun violence that people in the low income communities of Chicago witness in the streets, in their homes and in their classes every day. Most if not all of these tragedies are preventable. March for Our Lives Chicago holds the culprits of this plague of preventable gun violence accountable. We hold the NRA, the politicians that support them, and the arms manufacturers and dealers accountable. We also hold Illinois’ neighboring states accountable for having lax gun laws that lead to guns being brought into Illinois. Throughout this movement the voices of black and brown people have been widely ignored. With Chicago’s status as the seventh most racially diverse city in the nation, it is imperative we put a focus on intersectionality and raise these voices up. March for Our Lives Chicago includes the experiences of people of color, women, and LGBT individuals in our fight to make the streets safe for children again. In 2017, 3456 Chicago citizens were victims to gun violence. We cannot have one more.
