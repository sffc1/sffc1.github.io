call-script-text: "**SBE CALL SCRIPT:** Hi, my name is ___________ and I'm a registered
  voter in Illinois. I'm calling to ask the Board of Elections to continue to deny
  the Trump Administration’s illegitimate request for voter registration data. The
  people running the Commission, such as Kris Kobach, have a history misrepresenting
  data to justify making it harder for people to vote. Voting is the foundation of
  our democracy and Illinois should not collaborate with any nationalist efforts to
  undermine our democracy.\n\n**SBE EMAIL SCRIPT:**\nSend an email copying all four
  of these addresses:\nwebmaster@elections.il.gov\nssandvoss@elections.il.gov\ntech@indivisiblechicago.com\nstrikeforceforchange@gmail.com\n\nI
  am an Illinois resident and I’m writing you today because I am concerned about the
  Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity’s request for voter registration
  data and also about the State’s participation in the Interstate Voter Registration
  Crosscheck program.\n\nBoth systems are tainted by the oversight of Secretary Kris
  Kobach. Kobach has a long, well-documented history of supporting anti-immigration
  and voter suppression programs. He has lost multiple lawsuits to the ACLU in his
  efforts to disenfranchise voters.\n\nMoreover, I am incredibly disappointed that
  the State Board of Elections has decided not to put Illinois’ participation in Crosscheck
  on the agenda for the August 22nd Board meeting, despite demands from multiple state
  legislators and U.S. Representatives that Illinois abandon this program. \n\nRegarding
  Kris Kobach, his past actions telegraph the intent behind the Commission, which
  is not a legitimate government agency nor is it acting to fulfill a legitimate government
  purpose. They have no power to compel the SBE to provide the information they are
  requesting. It is quite clear that the Commission was created to justify President
  Trump’s debunked claims that millions of votes were cast illegally in the last election.
  In Crosscheck, Kobach intentionally built a flawed system to generate false and
  misleading statistics to bolster his lies of large-scale voter fraud. A system that
  disproportionately disenfranchises people of color. Undoubtedly, he is on this Commission
  to do the same. \n\nThe Illinois State Board of Elections is a steward of the public's
  sensitive voter registration data and has a responsibility to protect it from misuse
  at all cost.  It is clear, based on the personal and legal history of those in charge
  of managing both the Commission for Election Integrity and Interstate Crosscheck
  that they are manipulating our data to advance purposefully misleading notions of
  widespread voter fraud in an effort to advance even more restrictive voter registration
  programs designed to disenfranchise legal voters.  Crosscheck is an insecure and
  preposterously inaccurate system. A system that yields 99.5 percent false positives,
  is a clear waste of taxpayer resources. Considering the public outcry, legislator
  response, serious privacy and cyber security concerns with Crosscheck, the partisan
  issues associated with Kris Kobach, and the fact that state law requires the Board
  to participate in the non-partisan ERIC system, it should be a simple and reasonable
  \ decision for the SBE to immediately withdraw from this program.  \n\nBy participating
  in a program clearly designed to generate propaganda and lie to the American people,
  Illinois becomes a collaborator in this voter suppression scheme.\n\nI strongly
  urge the SBE to vote to refuse to release any data to the Commission and to put
  consideration of ending our state’s continued participation in the Interstate Crosscheck
  system on the August 22nd agenda.  Additionally, I call on the Board to deny any
  and all request for voter registration information from the Commission for Election
  Integrity, as it is not a government agency and it does not serve a legitimate government
  purpose. Those on the Commission have no regard for integrity in any way and have
  been shown in federal court to employ deceptive tactics to take away our right to
  vote.\n\n[YOUR NAME]\n[YOUR ZIPCODE]   "

Help end Illinois' participation in Crosscheck and to apply pressure to the Illinois State Board of Elections to refuse to legitimize the so-called Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity. We know that the true purpose of the Commission is to collect large quantities of data that they will manipulate to create misleading statistics to support the President's debunked claim that millions of illegal votes were cast in the last election.

These actions are time sensitive in preparation for the State Election Board meeting on September 19th in Chicago!

ACTIONS TO TAKE WITH THE STATE BOARD of ELECTIONS: 
We have two asks of the SBE:

1) Refuse to comply with Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity's request and provide them with no data.

2) Put the issue of Illinois' participation in the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck program on the agenda to vote to withdraw from the program.

**We need you to call the Illinois State Board of Elections (SBE) at 217-782-4141;**
when given the option, press 4 to connect to the Voter Registration Division. You will hear a recorded message that the Board plans to take this issue up at their August 22nd meeting. Continue the call until you speak with a person.

The people answering the phones will tell you to email webmaster@elections.il.gov. That's great--do that, too (see our email script)! Emails will be counted and considered on August 22nd at their meeting, but in the meantime, we need them to hear us before the meeting. Calls get their attention! SEE SBE CALL SCRIPT ABOVE.
