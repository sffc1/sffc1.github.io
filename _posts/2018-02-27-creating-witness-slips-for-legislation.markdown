If you are an Illinois resident, please complete witness slips on progressive bills we support. 

INSTRUCTIONS
For each bill you will need to create a new slip.

Once you select the bill and know the bill's number,  please follow these instructions: 

1. Under Section I, fill in your identification information (under business you can write “N/A”, “self” or “ICHV”)

2. Under Section II, write "self."

3. In Section III, select "Proponent"

4. In Section IV, select "Record of Appearance Only."

5. Agree to the ILGA Terms of Agreement.

6. Select the "Create Slip" button. You are done!

If you feel strongly about a bill, it's vitally important that you call and visit your ILGA Rep and Senator, and ask your friends to do the same. The slips are only seen/counted by a very small group of ILGA members to move the bill out of committee, but your reps must hear from you. It's the most effective way to influence them. 


If you're not sure who your ILGA members are look them up here: [https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx](https://ova.elections.il.gov/RegistrationLookup.aspx) 
Then find their contact information here:
House: [http://ilga.gov/house/](http://ilga.gov/house/) 
Senate: [http://ilga.gov/senate/](http://ilga.gov/senate/)
