RESISTANCE SUMMER - Online and in the media, it may seem that we are all hopelessly divided (or that we all agree).  But on the doorsteps, face to face, people are nuanced. They’re conflicted and have the same concerns about our shared country. And often the best way to persuade or motivate someone is to just show up and listen. 
That’s why this July, as Washington debates radical cuts to our health care system, progressives in all 50 states are taking to the doors to have thousands of conversations about healthcare and other issues in our country—and the solutions we need to fix it. The Neighborhood Listening Project is a way to practice and be trained on how to canvas in preparation for the 2018 elections. 

Greg Palast has written that purging of the voter roles for the 2018 election will be done at unprecedented levels. The purging has to be completed 60 to 90 days before an election. After which whomever is on the voter roles will have to stay on the roles. 

The recommended counter-action is to re-register people to vote (preferably with a voter receipt) 60 to 90 days before the election. So we will need more people trained in canvassing and more people trained to be deputy registrars!

Canvassing is the NUMBER ONE method for inspiring people to get out to VOTE. Exciting new research has shown that the BEST METHOD to persuade and motivate voters and change their minds about issues is to perform educational canvassing (also called deep canvassing). The Neighborhood Listening Project is a form of educational canvassing except you ask questions, share your story and LISTEN to their story, all in a non-judgmental way.
