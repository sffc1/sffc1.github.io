I am not sure why there are not any Activist Group or Campaign Sponsored Election Night Watch Parties in the South Suburbs, in Matteson or Country Club Hills or Homewood or South Holland or Lansing or Thornton or Markham or Calumet City or Robbins, etc. If you hear of any, please let us know. 

You can always stop by the J. B. Pritzker South Suburbs HQRS in Southwest Holland starting at 7pm.
