## CALL GOVERNOR RAUNER AND ASK HIM TO SIGN SB2273!!

You may recall that several Strike Force For Change members took the train into Chicago on several occasions this past Fall and Winter to join Indivisible Chicago and urge the State Board of Elections to end Illinois’ participation in Crosscheck (https://www.endcrosscheck.com).  Recall that Crosscheck was created by Kansas’ secretary of state and was fraught with algorithm flaws producing a high number of false positives and resulting in voter data purges and voter suppression. Crosscheck also had poor data security exposing millions of registered voters to hackers and potential identity theft.   

Indivisible National recently gave kudos to Illinois Indivisible Illinois groups on the ground for pushing on this issue and ultimately getting the Illinois legislature to pass a bill through both houses to pull the state out of the voter suppressive Crosscheck program   **The bill passed both houses on April 19th and was sent to Governor Rauner on May 18th for his signature.  We need to make sure that Governor Rauner signs this bill into law. ** 

Please call him this week and urge him to **sign SB2273** into law:
