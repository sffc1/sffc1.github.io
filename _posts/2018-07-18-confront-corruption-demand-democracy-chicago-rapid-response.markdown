With the shenanigans in Helsinki and the ongoing traitorous behavior from Trump (who just said weâ€™re no longer under attack from Russia), our Indivisible events tonight have blown up. 

Jonah called this weekâ€™s events an â€˜inflection pointâ€™, and we believe thatâ€™s true. Something fundamental has shifted. I just heard former Bush White House official Elise Jordan on MSNBC refer to a Kentucky TV station poll last night which said 80% of people did not believe Trumpâ€™s ludicrous walk-back.

Tonightâ€™s candlelight democracy events present us with a rare opportunity to gain some traction with people who DO want to defend and protect the Constitution, and to do so in an ongoing fashion. Indivisible has already held several candlelight democracy events around the Nation, with only a handful of determined individuals showing up, but now Indivisible-Chicago intends to push forward and tonight weâ€™ll let people know weâ€™ll host them EVERY WEEK; EVERY WEEK while these traitorous clowns are threatening to destroy our republic? 

The candlelight democracy vigils are a powerful tool. Just bring votive candles and signs. 

Indivisible may never get a better chance to get this movement off the ground, but we need your help.

Today, we stand at a turning point in our country and in this movement â€” Indivisible asks you to recruit 3 friends and take them to a protest in your community tonight.  Stand in solidarity with our allies tonight.  

**The Chicago Confront Corruption: Demand Democracy vigil** will convene on the Michigan Avenue Bridge, just south of the Tribune Tower.

Organizers will provide candles (please donate $1 to offset costs)- you can bring signs and your friends and your own candles. Speakers will include you, the people most affected by this widespread corruption and dysfunction, organizational leaders and grassroots activists who are working to hold the Trump administration accountable and create a democracy that works for everyone. Speakers will have two minutes to speak. There will be a total of 30 minutes of speaking so requests will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. Email the organizers for more information.

1 - Call your congressperson urge they take legislative action against Donald Trump
2 - Write letters to the editor
3 - tweet, share and visit your congressperson urging them to reign in and check this Presidentâ€™s power. 

We are now at more than 150 vigils and counting and had a plug from Rachel Maddow last night and Nancy Pelosi on twitter!
