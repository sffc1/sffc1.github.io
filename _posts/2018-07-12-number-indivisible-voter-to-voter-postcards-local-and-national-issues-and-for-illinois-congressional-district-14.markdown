Send 20,000 Postcards to IL14 and IL6 Voters

Indivisible - Illinois wants to mail 20,000 postcards to 10,000 voters (2 postcards each) in the Illinois 14th and 6th Congressional District ahead of the upcoming elections on November 6, 2018, and we’re grateful for your help!

We’re writing to district residents who share our values who did not vote in the mid-term elections, but did vote in general elections. We'll write the postcards from now until Labor Day September 3 but won't mail them until weeks and days before the election. 

On the blank backside of the postcards volunteers will write nonpartisan messages:

"Thank you for voting in 2016!"
"What’s your plan to get to the polls for the general election on November 6?"
"During this important moment for our country, let’s all vote and stay engaged."

Indivisible - Illinois will deliver postcards, addresses, and instructions to hosts.  All we need are volunteers, stamps, pens, wine and snacks!  Ten people can write about 300 postcards during one party.  Indivisible - Illinois will arrange the drop off or delivery of the completed and addressed postcards from our group afterwards and get them in the mail this fall.

The next Strike Force For Change meeting is on July 21st, 2018. Once again, after the brief meeting we will have an Indivisible Postcard Party.

We had Carrot Cake and Red Velvet Cake from Angelica's Bakery in Hazelcrest at the last Postcard Party. This time we are providing Buona sandwiches to nosh on while doing the heavy work of filling out postcards. We have ten slots but the room can hold more, so invite your friends. 

If you'd like to attend our Strike Force For Change Summer postcard-writing parties, please sign up with the RSVP Link.
