##Sponsored by Indivisible South Suburban Chicago

Come join us! Let's get to know each other better. Building community is the key to building a lasting resistance organization. ISSC is inviting other area groups too. ISSC will provide the hot dogs and hamburgers. Please bring a dish to share and BYOB.  *Alcohol permitted.* Please bring your kids, family, friends and neighbors. Please RSVP on Facebook or in the ISSC or SFFC Slack so we have enough to BBQ.
