Last week was an incredible week in Springfield – SB 1657, the Gun Dealer Licensing Act passed out of the Illinois House.  It’s great news – but our work is far from over!  The bill is now on Governor Rauner’s desk and we need you to take a couple quick actions:

·      Call Governor Rauner at 217-782-0244 and politely ask him to sign SB 1657 – the Gun Dealer Licensing Act into law

·      Share this information on social media – ask all your friends and family members to make the call
 
Have a few more minutes for gun violence prevention?
 
As was listed on our website last week there are also some other great measures that are moving through the General Assembly and we need your help to make sure they make it to Governor Rauner’s desk as well.   

Please take a moment to fill out a Witness Slip in SUPPORT of HB 3390 (Cassidy), which will remove for one year the Firearm Owner's Identification Card of a cardholder who reports to the local law enforcement agency his or her firearms lost or stolen in 3 separate incidents within a 2-year period. 

The Illinois House will likely be voting on HB 772 which would empower immediate family members and law enforcement to petition the courts to remove firearms from someone they think my be a danger to themselves or others.  The bill passed out of the Senate last week.  Please call your State Representative and tell them to vote YES on HB 772 (Willis/Morrison). 

Lastly, the following bills passed out of the Illinois House and could be called for a vote in the Illinois Senate as early as next week.  So call your State Senator and tell them to VOTE YES on each of these measures.

HB 1465 (Mussman/Munoz) – Which will raise the age to purchase an assault weapon to 21.

HB 1467 (Moylan/Raoul) – Will ban the sale of bump stocks in Illinois.

HB 1468 (Carroll/Morrison) – Will place a 72-hour waiting period on the sale of assault weapons.
