The 2018 Open Enrollment Period runs from November 1, 2017 to December 15, 2017 (Healthcare.gov). That is 6 weeks LESS than the 2017 Open Enrollment Period which ran from November 1, 2016 to January 31, 2017. In other words, your time to enroll consumers in a health plan went from 3 months down to just 45 days.

Spite is not a healthcare policy. Just after last week's congressional vote failed, Trump tweeted his desire to "let Obamacare implode." He subsequently said that "bailouts" for insurance companies -- by which he presumably meant the subsidies that enable insurers to offset costs for low-income consumers -- would be terminated. This continued sowing of confusion and doubt may be more tactical than strategic, or it may be neither; either way, it's unconscionable. The ACA -- for better and, in some instances, worse -- is the health-care system America has. If Fake 45 continues to try to destroy the law, he will not only erode his stature and the presidency's, he will also hurt vulnerable Americans.
