## ACTION NOW! 

[https://www.fightforthefuture.org](https://www.fightforthefuture.org)

It’s happening! In the midst of Fight For The Future's #OneMoreVote day of action on February 27th, the Senate and House both introduced resolutions to overrule Ajit Pai’s FCC and *save net neutrality.*

That’s the good news. But now the pressure’s on to find the final vote we need to win in the Senate, and the bad news is that Fight For The Future is running dangerously low on the grassroots funds needed to power their high-impact Congress-facing campaigns. 

If passed, the Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolutions introduced yesterday would block the FCC’s repeal, and restore basic protections that prevent giant cable companies from abusing their monopoly status to control what we see and do online.

If FFTF fails to beat back Ajit Pai’s attack, giant companies like Verizon and Comcast will get to decide where you can get news and information, how you watch videos and listen to music, and squeeze you for more money to access a less awesome Internet.

But Fight For The Future is not going to let that happen. We’re mobilizing the entire Internet, from popular websites to small businesses to millions of ordinary Internet users, and turning all of that online outrage into effective action directly focused on the lawmakers who are the most likely to come to our side and vote for the CRA.

Here’s what they have planned for the next few weeks:

* Continue to flood the Senate with calls and emails until we get that 51st Senate vote.

* Put dozens of pro-net neutrality companies in touch with the most likely Senate offices by organizing more small business delegations.

* Organize more in-district events that generate local press coverage in key lawmakers’ own backyards.

* Build the tech and mobilize websites and Internet users for a massive push as we approach a vote in the Senate, and prepare to take the fight to the House if (or rather when!) they win.

The day of action yesterday was a huge success, but now that we’re hurtling toward a vote in the Senate, the clock is ticking and every second of every day matters.

**The Internet is the most important tool we have to hold powerful people and institutions accountable. It’s our best defense against tyranny and corruption. We’re fighting to to protect it, and we’re fighting to win. **

**Contact your Member Of Congress to keep up the momentum!

The folks at Fight For The Future have a ton of momentum, but they are indicating that they urgently need to raise more funds or they will have to scale back their campaign.
