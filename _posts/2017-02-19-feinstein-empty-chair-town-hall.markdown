We have gotten confirmation from Senator Feinstein's office that she will NOT be attending this event. While we are disappointed in this decision, it will not change our plans -- the event is still on!

We want to make a powerful, positive statement that we want to work with her and she ought to be present . After a couple speeches from local luminaries taking a stand against the Trump agenda, we’ll invite the audience to share questions, stories, and messages which we’ll record and pass along to the Senator.

We also want to help attendees get more involved in the movement so we’re inviting representatives from local activist and community groups to distribute information and answer questions.

We’re still lining up the details, but we are in talks with some speakers we think you’ll be pretty pleased with.

Please note that an RSVP does not constitute a reservation. We’ll let you know when the event details are finalized and (free) tickets become available.
