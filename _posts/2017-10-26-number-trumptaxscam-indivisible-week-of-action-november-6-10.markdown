The #TrumpTaxScam bill is now public (it’s terrible), but WE CAN STOP IT. If we push back now, we can stop the GOP from sneaking through their Medicare-cut-forcing, middle-class-tax-raising giveaway to billionaires. After dropping their bill on Thursday, the GOP is trying to rush through the #TrumpTaxScam, another massive (massive) giveaway to the rich. And Indivisible groups are getting in gear to stop them.

We can’t stress this enough: so many things we care about are on the chopping block in the #TrumpTaxScam. Here’s what the bill does: 

* Gives huge tax cuts to the wealthy by phasing out the estate tax, repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax, and limiting the tax rate on income earned by hedge funds, private law firms, and the Trump Organization;

* Slashes the corporate tax rate, so corporations can line the pockets of their shareholders, and incentivizes moving operations offshore;

* Adds $1.5 trillion to the deficit, forcing deep cuts to Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security down the road.

House Republicans will begin marking up their bill as early as Monday. And the Senate may introduce their bill this week as well. Just like TrumpCare, Republicans’ only chance to get this bill through is if we don’t make enough noise. But, if we show national, mobilized, local opposition to this scam before most members of Congress (MoCs) make up their mind, we can stop them in their tracks. And. we. can. win.
