**Chicago's "Fighting 8th" and the 370th Regiment**

The Eighth Regiment of the Illinois National Guard is said to have started as the volunteer Hannibal Guard militia in the year 1871. They later became a division of the Illinois National Guard and was organized during the Spanish-American War of 1898 as an all-Black volunteer regiment. Called the "Fighting 8th" infantry, the regiment served along the Mexican border in 1916 and in France under Colonel Franklin A. Denison during World War I, when the regiment was incorporated into the 370th U.S. Infantry. It was the only unit entirely commanded by Black officers.

The Fighting Eighth gained special recognition as the regiment that finally drove and pursued the German forces from the Aisne-Marne region of France until the Armistice stopped their pursuit in 1918. Under the leadership of Brigadier General Richard L. Jones, the 370th Infantry Regiment was awarded 71 War Crosses with special citations for valor and merit and 21 Distinguished Service Crosses. General Jones was awarded the French Croix de Guerre for valor in battle.

The Victory Monument, created by sculptor Leonard Crunelle, was built to honor the service of Eighth Regiment of the Illinois National Guard during World War I. It is located in the Black Metropolis-Bronzeville District in the Douglas community area of Chicago, Illinois.

The 370th was reactivated in October 1942, along with the rest of the 92nd Division, ten months after the American entry into World War II. After nearly two years of training, it departed the United States in July 1944 and arrived on the Italian Front, landing at Naples on 1 August, attached to the Task Force 42 of the 1st Armored Division. 

On 1 April, the "Fighting 8th" 370th RCT and the attached 442nd Infantry (Nisei) attacked in the Ligurian coastal sector and drove rapidly north against opposition of German 148th Infantry Division supported by Italian coastal units. The 370th took over the Serchio sector and pursued a retreating enemy from 18 April until the collapse of enemy forces, 29 April 1945. 

On the Italian Front, the Black soldiers had an opportunity to make contact with men of many nationalities: beyond other segregated Americans units like the Japanese descendants, they had contact with the troops of British and French colonial empires (Black Africans, Moroccans, Algerians, Indians, Gurkhas, Jews and Palestinians) as well as with exiled Poles, Greeks and Czechs; anti-fascist Italians and the non-segregated troops of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force.
