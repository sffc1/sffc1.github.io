This is a grassroots group with volunteers planning the events and doing the work. We rather not spend our time raising money. We spring into action and strike a rapid response to respond to the godawful policy that is coming out of Washington and hold our elected official accountable to the citizens that elected them. We are planning Fall events to educate voters on the issues. This short fundraiser will primarily  be raising money for these civic actions and events. Go to the Fundraising Campaigns Website at:
