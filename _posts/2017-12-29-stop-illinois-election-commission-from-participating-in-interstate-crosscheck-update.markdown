## UPDATE - SB2273 has passed the Illinois Senate!!

### Now we move to the Illinois House!

**They are Using Our Voter Data For Voter Suppression In Other States!**
Indivisible groups across Illinois have been working to address Illinois' participation in the extremely flawed Interstate Crosscheck system. Crosscheck is a program created and operated by Kansas election officials. It collects voter registration information from participating states and “crosschecks” the data to find duplicate registrations. This program is the primary source for Kobach and Trump when citing “millions of illegal voters”. Yet, the program’s algorithm to identify illegal voters has been widely discredited and Kansas authorities who oversee the program have refused to take basic steps to improve the accuracy of the results. Therefore, Crosscheck generates intentionally-inflated statistics that exaggerate the instances of actual voter fraud by a factor of over 1,000.

Summer 2017 and Fall 2017, many Illinois elected officials sent letters and made appearances at the State Board of Elections supporting Illinois' withdrawal from this system. Unfortunately, the board deadlocked in a 4 to 4 party line vote, and Illinois remains in the system.

**A bill introduced in the State Senate, SB2273 which states that the Electronic Registration Information Center ("ERIC") will be the exclusive interstate registration program, has passed the Illinois Senate!** ERIC has been proven to be far more secure, infinitely more accurate, and less likely to be abused by any officials hoping to suppress minority voting.

**Now Our Important Work Moves To The Illinois House.**  

Attention is focused now on the Illinois House. The bill will now head to the House where Representative Ann Williams will be the chief sponsor.

**Will you make a call to your Illinois House Legislator to ensure they vote for the bill?**
