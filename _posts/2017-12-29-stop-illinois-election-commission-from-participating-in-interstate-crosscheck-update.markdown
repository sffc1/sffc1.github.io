Indivisible groups across Illinois have been working to address Illinois' participation in the extremely flawed Interstate Crosscheck system.

This Summer and this Fall, many Illinois elected officials sent letters and made appearances at the State Board of Elections supporting Illinois' withdrawal from this system. Unfortunately, the board deadlocked in a 4 to 4 party line vote, and Illinois remains in the system.

There is now a bill introduced in the State Senate, SB2273 which states that the Electronic Registration Information Center ("ERIC") will be the exclusive interstate registration program. ERIC has been proven to be far more secure, infinitely more accurate, and less likely to be abused by any officials hoping to suppress minority voting.

There are 10 State Senators who are signed on as co-sponsors of this important bill. We are asking that other state senators sign on to co-sponsor this bill. 

With primary elections approaching, the sooner we can move on this bill the better. The Crosscheck data exchange process has been proven to be insecure, so the personal information of all Illinois voters is at stake. Leaving Crosscheck will also insure that Illinois will not be an unwilling participant in voter disenfranchisement in any neighboring states.
