We had a successful Resistance Summer! 

Now the battle for Tax Fairness in the upcoming Budget and for clean DACA/DAPA legislation begins. 

This Summer, Americans banded together and defeated the Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare. Now we must do the same to prevent massive Tax Cuts for Millionaires and to get a clean DACA/DAPA Law on the books. 

At the next Strike Force For Change meeting on this Thursday, October 5th, we will 
1.	Talk about the upcoming DACA Event in December, 
2.	Have an Action on the Trump Tax Scam called Tax Reform, 
4.	discuss upcoming actions to help people understand the shortened Obamacare Open Enrollment period, 
4.	discuss and plan for our Winter Voting Rights Event and Spring Gun Violence Actions/Events.    

**Stand Up! Fight Back! Resist!**
