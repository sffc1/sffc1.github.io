## A Color Of Change Webinar

Join Free Press and Color Of Change for a virtual town hall as we discuss the state of our media 50 years after the release of the groundbreaking Kerner Report, which included a damning critique of how the media contributed to racial unrest in the 1960s.

We'll hear from Patrisse Khan-Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter; Malkia Cyril, executive director of the Center for Media Justice; Rinku Sen, writer and former president and executive director of Race Forward; Brandi Collins, senior campaign director at Color Of Change; and Roberta Rael, director of Generation Justice.
