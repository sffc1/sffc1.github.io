call-script-text: "***This could be a post card or phone call or tweet*: **\n\nSenator
  or Congressperson [name here] \n\nI urge you to vote YES on SB2388 SFA 1 in the
  Illinois Legislature!\n\nShort-term health plans are junk coverage that leaves those
  who get sick with big medical bills. SB2388 SFA 1 protects consumers in IL from
  short-term health plans by:\n\n•\tRequiring that any short-term plan sold in Illinois
  be limited to 90 days of coverage and prevent the plan from being renewed within
  a one-year period;\n\n•\tPreventing insurance issuers of short-term plans from discriminating
  against people with pre-existing conditions by refusing to sell coverage to them
  or canceling coverage when someone needs care; and \n\n•\tRequiring the application,
  sales, and marketing materials for short-term plans to include clear disclosures,
  such as: “WARNING! This plan may not cover all of the health care you need and may
  leave you with very high medical bills.”\n\nAgain, I urge you to vote YES to  SB2388
  SFA 1! Thank you for your attention.  "
