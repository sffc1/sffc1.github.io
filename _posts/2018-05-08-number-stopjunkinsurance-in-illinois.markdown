call-script-text: "***This could be a post card or phone call or tweet*: **\n\nSenator
  or Congressperson [name here] \n\nI urge you to vote YES on HB2624 SA1 and SA2 in
  the Illinois Legislature!\n\nShort-term health plans are junk coverage that leaves
  those who get sick with big medical bills. HB2624 SA1 protects consumers in IL from
  short-term health plans by: \n\n•\tRequiring that any short-term plan sold in Illinois
  be limited to 90 days of coverage and prevent the plan from being renewed within
  a one-year period;\n\n•\tPreventing insurance issuers of short-term plans from discriminating
  against people with pre-existing conditions by refusing to sell coverage to them
  or canceling coverage when someone needs care; and \n\n•\tRequiring the application,
  sales, and marketing materials for short-term plans to include clear disclosures,
  such as: “WARNING! This plan may not cover all of the health care you need and may
  leave you with very high medical bills.”\n\nAgain, I urge you to vote YES to HB2624
  SA1 and SA2! Thank you for your attention. "

First, in order to meet more upcoming bill deadlines, we had to switch bill numbers. The new bill number is HB2624 SA1 (if you recall, the previous bill number was SB2388 SFA1). SA1 to HB2624 has not been assigned to committee yet, so we can't complete witness slips support for it yet.
 
Second, there will be another amendment filed to HB2624 at some point today (it will be SA2).
 
The reason for senate amendment 2 (SA2) is because after meeting with the opposition last week, our bill sponsor and the senate insurance committee chair wanted to see if there is an amendment that can be a good compromise between what the consumer advocates want and what the opposition wants. We anticipate senate amendment 2 to HB2624 will be filed at some point on 5/16/2018. We won't know exactly when this will happen today though. We know the sponsor's goal is to get SA2 filed and assigned to committee before the committee meets today at 3:30pm.

So still, Call your State Senator at (312) 471-0261 and ask them to support the new bill number HB2624 SA1 and SA2: The Short Term, Limited Duration Insurance Coverage Act. 

Short-term plans are junk coverage that leave those who get sick with big medical bills. HB2624 SA1 and SA2 protects consumers in Illinois from short-term health plans by calling today.
