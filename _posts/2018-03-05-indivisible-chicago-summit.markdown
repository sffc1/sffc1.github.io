It's officially 2018 and that means one thing: the midterms are coming! Indivisible Chicago is teaming up with Let America Vote, Chicago Votes, Voto Latino, Swing Left, Flippable, and more to ensure the coming election is not just a Blue Wave, but a Blue Tsunami. Join us for the first All-Chicago Indivisible meeting in over a year! We will gather together to re-energize, re-engage, and re-orient towards taking back the House and Senate in 2018. We will hear from the leaders in progressive, grassroots election organizing and find out how Indivisible Chicago can take action and take back Congress.

We will win in 2018. We will finally have a real check on the executive branch. And you can make a difference.

4pm-4:45pm
Join us for a special panel discussing Millennials in politics with our guests Nicole Johnson, Bushra Amiwala, and Ugo Okere.
Nicole is a native of the Englewood community on Chicago's southside and aldermanic candidate. Bushra, age 19, is a DePaul student and also running for Cook County Commissioner. Ugo, age 21, is a Loyola student, 40th Ward community Organizer, and an Aldermanic candidate.
