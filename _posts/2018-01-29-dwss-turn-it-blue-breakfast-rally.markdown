This is an exciting fundraiser for the Democratic Women of the South Suburbs. These periodic fundraisers allow DWSS to donate to Democratic candidates including females and minorities and to support Democratic Party causes. 

With the #MeToo trend and the recognized effect of Black women in the Alabama election, many of us have come to realize that we need to elect more female candidates and that Black female candidates should emerge and should no longer just work hard in the background. 

Please support this DWSS Fundraiser if you can. Contact Hattie or Zaveola at ildwss@gmail.com if you want to donate your purchased ticket.
