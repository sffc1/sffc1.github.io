There is now a bill introduced in the State Senate, SB2273 which states that the Electronic Registration Information Center ("ERIC") will be the exclusive interstate registration program. ERIC has been proven to be far more secure, infinitely more accurate, and less likely to be abused by any officials hoping to suppress minority voting.

There are 10 State Senators who are signed on as co-sponsors of this important bill. We are asking that other state senators sign on to co-sponsor this bill. 

With primary elections approaching, the sooner we can move on this bill the better. The Crosscheck data exchange process has been proven to be insecure, so the personal information of all Illinois voters is at stake. Leaving Crosscheck will also insure that Illinois will not be an unwilling participant in voter disenfranchisement in any neighboring states.

The folks co-ordinating Indivisible-Illinois' efforts to remove Illinois from the Crosscheck system have identified 8 state senators who would be most valuable as co-sponsors at this time in order to push this bill along. 

Here's the list, by senate district.

1 Antonio Munoz (Pilsen, Little Village, SW side)*

3 Mattie Hunter (River North, West Loop, Chinatown, Back of the Yards, Englewood, Chatham)*

4 Kimberly Lightford (Austin, Forest Park, River Forest, Broadview, Westchester, Hillside)*

8 Ira Silverstein (Lincolnwood, Niles, Morton Grove)*

22 Cristina Castro (Hoffman Estates, Schaumburg, Elgin, Carpentersville)

30 Terry Link (Wheeling, Vernon Hills, North Chicago, Waukegan)*

31 Melinda Bush (Gurnee, Grayslake, Round Lake, Lindenhurst, Antioch, Zion)

57 James Clayborne (E St Louis, Granite City, Fairview Hts., Belleville)*

(* Executive Committee member)

Anyone calling should mention that Kwame Raoul and Bill Cunningham are the chief sponsors.  Don Harmon (who is senate President Pro-Tempore) is a chief sponsor.  Harmon is also Chair of the Executive committee so when you call an executive committee member, tell them that the chair is a chief co-sponsor.  That will make the staff aide you have to talk to pay more attention.
