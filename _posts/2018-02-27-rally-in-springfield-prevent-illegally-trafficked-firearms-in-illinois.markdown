## Anti-Gun Violence Lobby Day in Springfield

February 28th is the Anti-Gun Violence Lobby Day in Springfield. Let us know if you want to join us in Springfield. Carpools of Indivisible groups and other Activist groups are leaving from the South Suburbs starting at 6AM. Contact us on Facebook or on the Indivisible South Suburban Chicago Facebook page to get into a carpool. 

Right now it is urgent for us to pressure the Illinois General Assembly to pass the Gun Dealer Licensing Act - SB 1657. This bill has been introduced every year for 15 years and this year it has a chance to pass. 

Currently in Illinois, gun dealerships are not required to be licensed, making it difficult to prevent gun trafficking and straw purchases (buying a gun for someone who is prohibited by law to possess one.) This bill would also require them to run background checks on all employees and install cameras to monitor sales and thefts. 

**We want this to be a veto-proof vote.** 

We are asking everyone to call your state representative and ask them to vote 'yes' on Gun Dealer Licensing SB1657. It's easy and takes only a few minutes. You can find your Illinois General Assembly Representative at StrikeForceForChange.com and scroll to the bottom to see your Representatives

On Wednesday, Illinois lawmakers have the opportunity to fight back against gun violence in a big way and they need to hear from you NOW, while they’re making up their minds.

That's because SB 1657 — a bill that will help curb the number of illegal guns on our streets — is up for a vote in the House of Representatives.

The bill is gaining momentum and has already passed in the Senate — so now we're counting on you to keep it moving: Take action now and urge key lawmakers to make passing SB 1657 a priority.

Right now, just a few gun dealers are responsible for a majority of illegal sales within our state. SB 1657, or The Gun Dealer Licensing Act, would give Illinois the ability to require responsible business practices among gun dealers and hold corrupt dealers accountable. Among other things, the bill would:

Ensure gun store employees are trained on how to conduct background checks, identify questionable purchases, and properly store guns to prevent theft.

Require background checks on gun store employees who have access to firearms as part of their work.
Promote transparency and accountability by allowing for lawful inspection of gun dealerships by law enforcement and designated state agencies.

It's a common sense policy that would help reduce illegal gun sales, gun thefts, and gun trafficking.

In the wake of the tragedy in Florida, all eyes are on our lawmakers to do the right thing and take a stand for gun safety. Together, we can make sure they hear us.
