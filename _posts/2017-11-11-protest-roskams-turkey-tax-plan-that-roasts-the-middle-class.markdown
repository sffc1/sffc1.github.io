Peter Roskam is the headline speaker at this large GOP "Reagan Dinner" Fundraiser. There's no better opportunity to protest the lie of trickle-down economics, which are really just tax cuts for billionaires like the Koch Brothers.

With Thanksgiving only a few weeks away, billionaires and massive corporations will have many thanks for Peter Roskam, who is giving them trillions in tax breaks that will cut Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security and slash education and services that help seniors, women and people with disabilities.

The Roskam-Trump tax is a turkey that roasts the Middle Class, balloons the deficit, makes it more expensive to borrow money, raises taxes on small businesses and puts us back on the devastating and discredited road of “trickle-down economics.”
