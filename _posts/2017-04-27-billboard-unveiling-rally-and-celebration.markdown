We are combining the voices of the 14th Congressional District and the 6th Congressional District to Hold Reps Accountable! A billboard that holds Congressman Hultgren and Congressman Roskam accountable for their vote against our health care will be put up next to the address listed here; thanks to the funds raised through #signsforsellouts.  

On Tuesday, August 29th we will begin to gather at 5:00 pm, have speakers at 5:30 pm and continue our protest until approximately 7:00 pm. There is parking by an abandoned building behind the sign and in the general area. Please be safe when arriving and park in an appropriate spot. Bring your own signs about health care, taxes, diversity, climate change, etc. (We will also be able to supply signs.) Show up for the full 2 hours or stop by on your way home from work. 

##Wear Your STRIKE FORCE FOR CHANGE Protest T-Shirts!!!
