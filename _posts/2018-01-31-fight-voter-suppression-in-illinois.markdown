===============================================
# FILL THE ROOM EVENT

## With the big wins for Democratic Party Candidates on Tuesday, November 7th, 2017, do you think that the Republicans are going to take this lying down?!?!?

### Republicans are thinking that NOW THEY HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT VOTER SUPPRESSION!

On Wednesday, November 15th at 12:00pm, our legislators turn the tables and they'll be the ones demanding answers from the Illinois State Board of Elections! Join Indivisible Chicago to "Fill the Room" at the State Senate Telecom and InfoTech Committee Hearing which is looking into Illinois' participation in the Crosscheck program and the massive security failures that Indivisible Chicago has brought to light. The Committee has called representatives from the State Board of Elections to testify as well as industry cybersecurity experts and members of the Indivisible Chicago team.
Crosscheck is a discriminatory system used to purge voters and promote voter suppression laws in our neighboring states. Read more on our [new website! https://www.endcrosscheck.com/](https://www.endcrosscheck.com)

WHEN: Wednesday, November 15, 2017 12:00pm
WHERE: 160 N LaSalle (across the street from the Thompson Center), 6th floor committee room.
NOTE: Photo ID is required to pass building security

As we always have stressed, we are not there to disrupt the normal order of the proceedings. We're there to witness the SBE's answers to our legislators questions and support the call to end Illinois' participation in Crosscheck immediately and to NOT send our data as currently planned this January.
