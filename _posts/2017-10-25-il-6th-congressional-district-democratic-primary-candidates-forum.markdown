The Glenbard North Civics Club and The Coalition for a Better Illinois 6th are pleased to co-host the [IL-6th Congressional District Democratic Primary Candidates Forum](https://www.facebook.com/events/1306877362751826/) to be held at Glenbard North High School on December 12th from 7-9pm. The Forum kicks off the official campaign as it is the first gathering of the challengers following the filing of petitions to enter the race. The Primary Election is on Tuesday, March 20, 2018.

We are pleased and excited to announce that Mary Ann Ahern, Political Reporter, NBC5 Chicago, will moderate and host the Forum. Ahern follows politics in Chicago, Springfield, and Washington, D.C for NBC 5 NEWS and NBCChicago.com and is closely followed locally and nationally.
