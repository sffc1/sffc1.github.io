Just earlier this week, all of our calling and tweeting and visiting to Senators paid off as senators began announcing that they could not support Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's disastrous "repeal and replace" bill.

But McConnell is moving the goalposts again. Trumpcare still isnâ€™t dead. Last night, a group of Senate Republican holdouts met in yet another attempt to reach a compromise on their plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

So help us to keep up the pressure. Here are a list of Senators that are on the fence. Tweet at them or give them a call to ask them to reject repeal of the ACA!
