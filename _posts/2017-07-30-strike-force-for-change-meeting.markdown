We had a successful August Recess and a successful Resistance Summer (see the Website: StrikeForceForChange.com for updates). 

Now the battle for Tax Fairness in the upcoming Budget and for clean DACA/DAPA legislation begins.  

As well as the struggle for clean legislation for an aid package for Hurricane Harvey victims and for ensuring that Trumpâ€™s Mar-A-Lago Resort gets NOT ONE PENNEY of Federal hurricane relief aid for any damage done by Hurricane Irma. He can afford to pay for any damage to his resort!

This Summer, Americans banded together last week and defeated the Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare. Now we must do the same to prevent massive Tax Cuts for Millionaires and get a DACA/DAPA Law on the books. 

At the next Strike Force For Change meeting on this Thursday, September 7th, we will 
1.	look at strategies for getting DACA/DAPA legislation passed and ways to help DACA/DAPA Immigrants locally, 
2.	we will do training on updating the content of the Strike Force For Change website (bring your laptops),  
3.	schedule training on canvassing and making phone calls, 
4.	discuss and plan for the  upcoming actions to help get people registered in the Fall for Obamacare,   
4.	discuss and plan for our Spring campaign on gun violence and our Fall and Winter Actions/Events.  

You will also have the chance to register for a **webinar hosted by Keith Ellison** and others on Tuesday, September 12th where we will discuss Tax Fairness to prevent massive tax cuts for millionaires and to learn more about how to engage in the Tax Fairness Campaign on a Local, State and Federal level, learn key talking points, etc.  

**Stand Up! Fight Back! Resist!**
