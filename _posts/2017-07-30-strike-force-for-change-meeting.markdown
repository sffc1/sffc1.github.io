July was very busy and we had several successes. At this meeting, let's take a moment to reflect on our successes. 

We now live in a era that requires a rapid response. So think about what actions that you can reasonably take to participate in a rapid response. Let's also plan for some actions for the August Town Halls and for events into the Fall. 

Bring a snack if you like!
