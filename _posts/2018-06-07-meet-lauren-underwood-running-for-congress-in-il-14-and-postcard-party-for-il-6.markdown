Lauren Underwood is a nurse from Naperville who is stepping forward to run for Congress to represent the Illinois 14 district. In a tough congressional race, she will be facing Randy Hultgren (R). 

Raised in Naperville, Lauren is committed to fighting for families and believes that strong jobs, smart investments, and access to affordable health care, will put the 14th district back on track.

To hear a bit more about Lauren, take a look at this video. Hope to see you all then.

UPDATE: Just a note we will be filling out Postcards for Sean Casten during the second half of the meeting. He is running against Peter Roskam in the IL-6th Congressional District. The Postcards will be turned over to the Coalition for a Better 6th for mailing as we get closer to the election. Please join us if you can and bring your creativity with you.
