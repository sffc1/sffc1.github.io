The next Strike Force For Change meeting is on **September 29th, 2018**. After the brief meeting we will have an Indivisible Postcard Party. This is our LAST POSTCARD PARTY before we must mail the postcards by mid-October 2018. If you have completed postcards from the last postcard party, bring them to this postcard party so that we can place stamps on them. 

Even though it is technically Autumn, you can still get that last hotdog of the Summer! Portillo's provides all of the fixings for creating your own Chicago Style Hotdog...but, please, no ketchup! This Autumn we have more targeted Activist Events so go to the [StrikeForceForChange.com](http://StrikeForceForChange.com) website and Facebook page to see how you can do your part to make the big changes that we need in Illinois and in Washington, DC.

Again, we will have great prizes for the volunteers who address the most postcards. We will both address postcards and then put stamps on the cards in order to get them mailed out in mid October. We put up ten slots on the online sign-up page but the room can hold more, so invite your friends to grab a hotdog. 

One of the state-wide goals of INDIVISIBLE-ILLINOIS is to contact every single voter in the designated federal and state flippable districts in Illinois (SFFC is concentrating on IL-6 and IL-14). We want to educate voters on how their legislator voted on key issues and urge them to vote in this critical Congressional Election in November. 

INDIVISIBLE-ILLINOIS is sending postcards to each of those constituents urging them to vote. This will require LOTS of postcards! So every INDIVISIBLE group throughout Illinois is taking some time to write up postcards. All of the postcards will be gathered by INDIVISIBLE-ILLINOIS and then mailed out in mass a few weeks before the election.

Indivisible-Strike Force For Change can help Indivisible make a big impact on getting out the vote in Illinois and flipping districts. So join us after this meeting and after every Indivisible-Strike Force For Change meeting this Summer to enjoy refreshments and write postcards.
