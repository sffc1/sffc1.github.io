Join us for an engaging conversation with two successful local leaders and activists -- and the only two women running for Congress in the 4th and 5th districts. Hear where Sol Flores and Sameena Mustafa stand on the issues, and learn more about what motivated them to run for office.

The format will be moderated Q&A with the two candidates. With the election a week later, this may be your last chance to meet and get to know these candidates before you cast your vote!

When: TONIGHT, Wednesday, March 14 from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m.
Where: Gideon Welles (4500 N. Lincoln Ave.)

**Action 2: TOMORROW - Vigil/Rally in Support of Families Separated in Immigration Detention**

Community groups, religious leaders, immigration advocates, and others concerned with fair and humane treatment for immigrants in detention are calling on all Chicago-area residents to join them at the Federal Plaza in downtown Chicago on Thursday, March 15 at 5 p.m. Participants will demand that the federal government stop separating mothers and small children while in immigration detention.

The vigil and rally come after news reports – and a lawsuit – revealed that a Congolese woman has been separated from her daughter for months, after the two arrived in November to Southern California seeking asylum. The child, age 7, has been held in a detention facility in Chicago while her mother remains in San Diego.

Government reporting on conditions in detention centers is extremely limited and opaque. However, immigration advocates across the nation report that more mothers and families have been separated in detention. Last week, a nationwide class action lawsuit was filed to address the issue.

Speakers at the event will include religious leaders, immigrant advocates, leaders from Chicago’s Congolese community and others. 

When: TOMORROW, Thursday, March 15 from 5 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.
Where: at Federal Center and Plaza (219 S Dearborn St.)

**Action 3: Early Voting Now Through March 19**

Did you know that less than 18% of Chicagoans who were registered to vote actually did in the last non-presidential primary? There are a lot of things we do really well in Chicago, but turning out to vote isn’t one of them. The next non-presidential primary is coming up on March 20, and early voting started on February 21st. Voting and civic engagement is vital for a healthy democracy.

The state races are important on issues like funding schools and social services. Cook County races are important on issues like taxation, jail reform, and healthcare services. Cast your vote early:

Check if you are registered already. Not registered to vote? No problem. Illinois offers same day registration at all of our early voting locations. Just bring 2 forms of ID. See when you need ID to vote.

Find your ballot at Ballotready.org

Register to vote by mail (deadline is March 15), or pick an early voting place and go vote!
