The next Strike Force For Change meeting is on **August 25, 2018**. Once again, after the brief meeting we will have an Indivisible Postcard Party. If you have completed postcards from the last postcard party, bring them to this postcard party. We will have stamps available. 

We talked about Trump so much that we did not get to eat our Buona Beef sandwiches, so attendees did a Buona Beef carry-out! And congrats to the prize winners who addressed the most postcards. They got their choice of prizes and walked off with summer straw pink pussy-cat hats. Those will be great to canvass in this summer! 

This time we are getting Panera. We will both address postcards and then put stamps on the cards in order to get them mailed out. We put up ten slots on the online sign-up page but the room can hold more, so invite your friends. 

One of the state-wide goals of INDIVISIBLE-ILLINOIS is to contact every single voter in the designated federal and state flippable districts in Illinois (SFFC is concentrating on IL-6 and IL-14). We want to educate voters on how their legislator voted on key issues and urge them to vote in this critical Congressional Election in November. 

INDIVISIBLE-ILLINOIS is sending postcards to each of those constituents urging them to vote. This will require LOTS of postcards! So every INDIVISIBLE group throughout Illinois is taking some time to write up postcards. All of the postcards will be gathered by INDIVISIBLE-ILLINOIS and then mailed out in mass a few weeks before the election.

Indivisible-Strike Force For Change can help Indivisible make a big impact on getting out the vote in Illinois and flipping districts. So join us after this meeting and after every Indivisible-Strike Force For Change meeting this summer to enjoy refreshments and write postcards.
