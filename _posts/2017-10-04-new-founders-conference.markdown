The conference aims to bring in four types of groups: Consultants who want to be on the cutting edge of new tools and systems; Potential candidates who want to build change as part of their platform; Political and tech organizations that want to enter the ecosystem and network; Innovative activists who want to leap directly into tool building alongside some of the greatest leaders around.

“The focus of this conference is not to talk AT people, show how smart we are and suggest that ‘we’ know how to fix it all” states Heidi Sieck, a long-time civic entrepreneur and leader of #VOTEPROCHOICE. “The focus is collaboration and to explore blueprints that can fix several major infrastructure problems, crowdsourced from people in the field. We want to brainstorm the best solutions, period.”

Tickets for the conference are available at www.newfoundersconference.com for $199 (until September 22nd), $249 (general admission) and $949 (VIP) with over 70% of proceeds going to the building of critical infrastructure. Students and emerging leaders can apply for scholarships to attend. The conference will have a TED-like feel, and feature several famous entertainers and various visionaries throughout the tech and political fields. www.newfounders.us

**Strike Force For Change has free Tickets available to members of SFFC and DWSS who get in touch with Dorothea. **
