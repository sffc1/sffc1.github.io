**Protest Trump's Horrific and Inhumane Policy of Separating Children From Their Parents**

We need to raise our voices against they key actors who are carrying out Trump’s family separation order: ICE and U.S. Attorneys. ICE apprehends and separates families while US Attorneys enforce the separation in legal proceedings. We need to stand up against this incompetence and the moral abomination of family separation.

We're excited to be partnering with the National Domestic Workers Alliance, MomsRising, United We Dream, MoveOn and many others to hold family-friendly rallies across the country. Bring your friends, wheel your stroller on over, grab your lunch boxes, and make your family's voice heard loud and clear, that #FamiliesBelongTogether.

When: Thursday, June 14, 12:00 PM
Where: ICE - Chicago Field Office
101 West Congress Parkway 4th Floor, Suite 4000
Chicago, IL 60605
