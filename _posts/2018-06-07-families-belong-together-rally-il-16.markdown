Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger (R-IL16) has said that he is against the horrific Trump policy of separating children from their parents at the borders, but he has not signed on the sponsor a bill that would allow this issue to come before the Congressional House. And he still will not have a Town Hall to speak with the voters. 

To put pressure on him, his constituents are holding a rally and have invited **Democratic contender Sara Dady** to speak on the issue.

Congressional Call to Action on Border Policy and Immigration Reform Rally

Hosted by:
Action Steps for America 
DeKalb Stands
Action for a Better Tomorrow Sauk Valley
Welcoming Western Counties Solidarity & Sanctuary Coalition

Speakers:
Sara Dady IL 16 Congressional Candidate 
And community members

Join us in a community wide gathering of solidarity as we demand an immediate halt and end to the horrifically in humane Trump Administration “zero tolerance” border policy. Over 600 children have already been separated from their parents at the border. That includes babies as young as 18 months old being ripped from their mother’s arms and then placed in shelters, with parents not knowing where their children are or whether they are ok, leaving families in agonizing anguish. Many of these families have presented themselves at the boarder seeking asylum. This barbaric policy is a sadistically cruel form of child abuse, where even very young children are torn from their parents and detained in shelters/warehouses, in unknown conditions. Even members of Congress are unable to enter and locked out of buildings with blacked out windows, unable to see and asses the shelter conditions housing children living in perpetual trauma. 

This is not American, this is not justice and the United Nations Human Rights Department is also calling for an immediate halt to this policy. This Tuesday morning, the statement called on the U.S. to adopt “adopt non-custodial alternatives that allow children to remain with their families and fulfill the best interests of the child, their right to liberty and their right to family life.” The UN called the separations “arbitrary and unlawful.” and called the practice a “serious violation” of children’s rights. 

In light of recent Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the Illinois 16th, Congressional candidate Sara Dady will speak at the rally and hold a press conference, with the intent of calling on Congress to take action on immigration reform.

“It’s been almost ten months since the President announced the end of DACA, and we’re no closer to finding real solutions to fix our broken immigration system,” according to Sara. “I think we can all agree that the current situation is untenable, yet the leaders we send to Congress have consistently failed to address the problems. Communities are in chaos, families are being torn apart, and law enforcement agencies are put in impossible situations, all because of moral paralysis in our nation’s capital.” 

On Friday, Sara intends to issue a challenge to members of Congress to fix DACA, and will give specific recommendations to do so.

Please join us and bring signs!
