New Founders has announced the discussion topics that have been chosen for our breakout sessions during the #ForTheWIN2018 conference! These discussions will bring together activists, leaders, entrepreneurs, and anyone who wants to have a real discussion around the issues. We will have writers and note-takers present to record theses incredible discussions so that we're able to broadcast to the world that we're here and ready to make a difference. Don't miss out on your chance to join the discussion. 
Conference attendees will have the option to choose one of each breakout session from each day.

Day 1 Breakout Session Choices

Breakout Session A: How can we achieve gun reform in the face of the NRA funding of candidates? How can we decrease gun violence? 

Breakout Session B: How are we changing access to and collection of election/election official data? What would it take to get and maintain a complete database of elections, incumbents, and challengers? 

Breakout Session C: How will voter files evolve as technology continues to take over and bureaucracy roadblocks innovation? 
Breakout Session D: How can candidates know which tech tools are best for their campaign? How can they learn to leverage multiple tools together? 

Day 2 Breakout Session Choices

Breakout Session A: How can we drastically increase voter registration in areas with historically low voter registration? 

Breakout Session B: How can we best target and fill empty (democratic/left/progressive) seats? 

Breakout Session C: How can we aid areas in low levels of economic prosperity? 

Breakout Session D: How can we best engage millennials in November and in 2020? 

When we are closer to conference-day all participants will be emailed reading materials so that we are able to bulk up on our topic before the discussion. The New Founder's can't wait to hear your voice at #fortheWIN2018.
