### From TheHill.com

Lyft will offer discounted and free rides to users who take advantage of the service to go to the polls on Election Day, the company said Thursday.

The ride-share company is teaming up with a host of voter turnout organizations to offer a 50 percent off promotion on Nov. 6. The company will also offer free rides to "underserved communities that face significant obstacles to transportation," according to a statement.

Lyft is working with Vote.org, TurboVote, Nonprofit Vote and When We All Vote. The latter group is a voter registration push backed by former first lady Michelle Obama.

Users will only receive the discount when traveling to vote, and will not be able to benefit from the promotion during their return trip.

In addition to discounted rides, Lyft said it will remind passengers about registration deadlines and offer in-office voter registration to employees.

Business Insider first reported on the initiative.

Ride-sharing companies like Lyft and Uber have in the past partnered with municipalities to assist voters in getting to the polls and locating their polling place.

Democrats have expressed optimism that a strong voter turnout in this year's midterm will propel them to retake control of the House, and possibly the Senate.

Republicans are hoping to stave off a Democratic surge. President Trump has expressed more optimism, suggesting a "red wave" is possible.

A RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Democrats with a 6.6 point lead over Republicans in the generic congressional ballot.
