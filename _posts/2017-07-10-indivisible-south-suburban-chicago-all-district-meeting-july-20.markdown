Indivisible South Suburban Chicago will have a general meeting (all congressional districts) to debrief past events, give updates from individual CD meetings and plan upcoming actions. We need to show Congress that there is broad resistance to Trumpâ€™s agenda. Join this meeting where you can help plan Congressional office visits, coordinate phone calls, and more.
