We can't expect to hold the Republicans and this administration responsible for their corruption if we lose ground in the United States Senate. Many of us grew up in Indiana, own property in Indiana or have relatives in Indiana so we have a vested interest in making sure that Hoosiers get out the vote for Senator Donnelly and other Candidates to ensure that they retain their seats. 

There are many groups doing canvassing in Northwest Indiana to get out the vote in general and for Senator Donnelly. 

Below are some contacts and some links through which you and your fellow activists can sign up to canvass this weekend and beyond and help get out the vote for candidates that reflect our values up and down the ticket.
