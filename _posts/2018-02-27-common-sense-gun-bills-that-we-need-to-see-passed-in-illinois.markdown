  Script - House\n\nHello, May I speak to (General Assembly Member)?\n\nHi, my name
  is (your name) and I'm a volunteer with the Illinois Gun Violence Prevention Coalition.
  I'm calling today to ask your help to help reduce gun violence in Illinois by giving
  a call to your State General Assembly-person Anthony Delucca to make sure he votes
  YES on SB 1657: Gun Dealer Licensing. This is a bipartisan bill which could seriously
  reduce gun violence in Illinois. Do you have a moment to speak? \n\n*If YES, move
  below. **If NO, THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. HAVE A GREAT NIGHT.***\n\nDid you know
  that gun dealers in Illinois are not licensed? You have to have a license to drive
  your car, hair salons are required to have a license, dog groomers have to have
  them, too, but gun dealers are not. In addition: \n\n* Right now government data
  shows that 3 local gun dealers are selling 17% of all the crime guns recovered on
  the streets of Chicago. \n\n* In fact, in over just 4 years, 1500 guns recovered
  at crime scenes were traced back to just 1 gun dealer, in comparrisiopn with most
  gun stores that sold just 3 crime guns. \n\nGun Dealer Licensing is a bill that
  would make sure all gun dealers are employing common sense business practices like:
  \n\n* Background checks on all employees,\n\n* Videotaping security measures for
  all gun stores,\n\n* and proper training on how to perform background checks. \n\n**Can
  we count on you to support the Gun Dealer Licensing Act? **\n\nAs I said before,
  your State Representative Anthony Deluca is going to vote on this bipartisan legislation
  that can ensure that all gun dealers in Illinois are following these common sense
  business practices. Can we count on you to call leader Deluca to tell him to vote
  YES on SB 1657 - Gun Dealer Licensing Act when it comes to a vote in the State House?
  (Answer contact legislator question)\n\n***If YES move below and mark YES. If NO:
  Thanks you for your time. Have a great night. ***\n\nGreat! Do you have a pen and
  paper? I want to give you his office number. *(make sure they take down the number
  and read it back)*\n\nSpringfield Office: 217-782-1719\n\nThanks so much for talking
  to me tonight! We will be sure to follow up with you to see how the conversation
  went. Thanks and have a great night.  \n\n"
