Strike Force For Change has partnered with Indivisible-National to set up a fundraising page. Indivisible National has worked with ActBlue to give all of the Indivisible Chapters across the country the opportunity to raise money for their Indivisible chapter.

The focus of the fundraising for Strike Force For Change will be for the Gun Buy Back event planned in August in Dolton. The funds raised between now and August 2018 will go toward the Gun Buy Back Event. 

Our goal is to raise $100,000.00 to provide enough VISA gift-cards to to buy back guns from all who come to turn one in. We don't want to have to turn people away and allow them to keep their guns. 

We will have more information about the Gun By Back Program and how you can volunteer to help in the coming weeks.
