## Organizing For Action - Northwest Suburbs 
### August 23rd Fiscal and Economic Issues Meeting (Action Planning Session)

Northwest Suburbs Organizing For Action (NWSOFA) 

When:    Wed, August 23, 2017 
Time:    7:00 PM - 10:00 PM
Host:    Karl Faulstich
Location: Schaumburg Township Library 
130 South Roselle Road

Come get the facts about the economic recovery nationally and the status of ongoing appropriations challenges at both the state and national level.

We have added about 2.2 million jobs nationally in the last 12 months (through June), with 222,000 jobs added in June. In June the (U-3) unemployment rate was at 4.4%, while the U-6 rate was 8.6%. The U-6 rate is down from a high of 17.1% during the downturn and is close to the 8.4% rate in the fall of 2007 before the Great Recession of December 2007 to June 2009.

The July job numbers will be released in early August and we will be discussing those results at our August 23rd meeting.

In early July, the Illinois legislature overrode Governor Rauner's vetoes. Illinois now has a full budget for the first time in over two years!!! We discussed what is and is not in the budget that passed at our July meeting, but will update things for SB1 (school funding) and other issues that affect Illinois. We will also be discussing Illinois job growth, which showed substantial improvement in June (and revisions to May).

Hopefully Illinois job growth will continue to improve. Bring your articles and other topics. Come join us for some exciting discussions.

Then come join us for continued discussions at Lou Malnati's after 9:30 pm. While OFA may not be political, we can discuss the politics of what is happening now at Lou's.
