Controversial Stageplay hits Belmont's Theater District. 

As the murder rate in Chicago continues to climb, as Black communities continue to be the targets of overzealous policing, and as the news fills with stories of law enforcement facing little or no penalty for murdering African-Americans, 'Low Hanging Fruit' is destined to be the most talked about original play this year.
