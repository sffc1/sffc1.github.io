This is our chance to be part of the discussion and ask for the policies for which we want our Democratic Members of Congress to promote and demand. 

We can ask our MoC to NOT vote for the budget nor vote to raise the debt limit unless they get the amendments that WE WANT!!  

Respectfully start tweeting and postcarding our MoCs for the following: 

HEALTHCARE: 
1. Include a public option like Medicare-For-All, 
2. Restore an adequate Risk corridor and, 
3. Change the law to allow the federal government and/or the states to negotiate lower drug prices for Medicare and the Healthcare exchanges.

GUN SAFETY REFORM: 
1. Gun Dealer Federal Licensing. Encourages better business practices among gun dealers and hold corrupt dealers accountable. 
2. Support Making Sure ALL Ammunition Sold In the United States is Traceable (similar to Illinois HB0271)

VOTING RIGHTS: 
1. Restore the funding for the Federal Election Commision that combats voting machine hacking. 
2. Restore the Voting Rights Act according to the new standards from the Supreme Court. 
3. Request Congresswoman Kelly draft a letter, like several other MoC and State legislators have done, calling for Illinois' immediate withdrawal from Crosscheck and that Illinois refuse to send any data to the Trump Election Commission. 

I am sure that we can think of more....
