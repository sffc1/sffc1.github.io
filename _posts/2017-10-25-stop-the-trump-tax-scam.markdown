call-script-text: "Postcard/Phonecall Talking Points:  \n\nI am worried that Trump’s
  tax plan, and the one I have seen from House Speaker Paul Ryan, would increase the
  deficit by trillions of dollars. And since Republicans in the Senate want to pass
  the bill through reconciliation, they’ll have to offset these huge tax cuts for
  the wealthy and corporations with cuts to Medicare and Medicaid and Education in
  order to make them permanent. Will you commit to me, your constituent, that you
  will oppose any tax plan that jeopardizes Medicare and Medicaid and Education to
  pay for tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations?\n\nWithout his tax returns, the
  American people have no way of knowing how much tax cuts will benefit Trump and
  his businesses. The taxpayers deserve to know if our hard-earned money is going
  to the President’s personal gain. Will you oppose any tax cuts until President Trump
  release his tax returns so that the American people can fully understand how it
  will personally benefit him and his businesses?\n\nI don’t believe that cutting
  taxes for the rich will do anything for the economy, except to make the rich richer.
  I’ve paid taxes my whole life and think that you, as my Representative, should be
  prioritizing me and my family, not the wealthy. Will you commit to me, your constituent,
  that you will oppose any new tax cuts for the rich?\n\nFew corporations actually
  pay their fair share in taxes. Many pay none at all. It’s unfair that many rich
  corporations are paying less in taxes than people like me. Even Donald Trump is
  bragging about how corporate profits have never been higher. If that’s true, then
  why do they need a huge tax cut? Will you commit to me, your constituent, that you
  will oppose any tax plan that cuts taxes for corporations or leaves corporate tax
  loopholes in place?\n"

Tax Reform = A Trump Tax Scam to give Massive Tax Cuts to the Rich.  
Here’s the first thing to know: this is not going to be true tax reform. Calling it “tax reform” suggests they intend to close corporate loopholes or address the growing wealth inequality that the current tax code fuels. But that’s not what Republicans have in mind. Instead, they want tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations paid for by taking away Medicare, Medicaid, and education funding. The problem is, their tax cuts are geared almost exclusively for the wealthy and corporations, leaving the middle class falling further behind with barely a token reduction in their taxes—just enough to trick you into falling for it.
