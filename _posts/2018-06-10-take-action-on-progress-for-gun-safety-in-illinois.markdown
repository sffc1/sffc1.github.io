call-script-text: Finally, as you know, both the Illegal Gun Trafficking bill (SB
  337) and the Firearm Restraining Order bill (SB 2354) passed last week in the Illinois
  General Assembly. Now we need to drive calls to Governor Rauner's office to be sure
  he will sign. Please take a minute to do this. His number is 312-814-2121. And you
  can call every day if you are able! Let's get these signed into law!

As you know, both the Illegal Gun Trafficking bill (SB 337) and the Firearm Restraining Order bill (SB 2354) passed in early June in the Illinois General Assembly. Now we need to drive calls to Governor Rauner's office to be sure he will sign the bills. Please take a minute to do this. His number is 312-814-2121. And you can call every day if you are able!
