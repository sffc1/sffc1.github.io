Pledge to join a June 30 #FamiliesBelongTogether Action
Donald Trump and his administration are cruelly separating children from their families. But we won't allow it to continue. 

On June 30, we're rallying around the country and in Washington, D.C., to tell Donald Trump and his administration to stop separating kids from their parents!

Trump and his administration have been systematically criminalizing immigration and immigrants, from revoking Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) to ramping up intimidating ICE tactics. 

Pledge to take action on June 30! Fill out and submit the form to let us know we can count on you to [join us in protest on Saturday, June 30](https://act.moveon.org/survey/June_30_Pledge/?source=homepage). You'll then be able to find an [event near you ](https://act.moveon.org/event/families-belong-together/search/?utm_source=front&utm_content=nav)

Let's send a clear message to Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress: Families Belong Together.
