## with participation from Indivisible South Suburban Chicago

The purpose of the Gubernatorial Candidates Forum is to give South Suburban Chicago voters of Cook and Will Counties an opportunity to hear candidates discuss the issues of importance to them in the Illinois 2018 gubernatorial election. Residents of the Chicago Southland area are encouraged to bring their questions and concerns about Illinois and its government. The candidates will answer audience submitted questions in this moderated event. 

All eight of the gubernatorial candidates—venture capitalist J.B. Pritzker; Chris Kennedy, former Chairman of the University of Illinois Board of Trustees; Chicago Alderman Ameya Pawar; Sen. Daniel Biss, D-Evanston; Bob Daiber, a school superintendent in Madison County; small business owner Alex Paterakis; Tio Hardiman, former director of CeaseFire; and State Rep. Scott Drury, D-Highwood—have accepted the invitation to participate. 

The Moderator for the Gubernatorial Candidates Forum is Craig Dellimore, Political Editor of WBBM News radio 780 AM and 105.9 FM. The Moderator will choose questions submitted by the audience on provided index cards or submitted beforehand to StrikeForceForChange@gmail.com. 

The event is free and open to the public.
